            In May 2011, producer Shinsadong Tiger and AB Entertainment scouted several trainees from JYP Entertainment to form a new girl group. Trainee Yuji was the first to join when a JYP girl group failed to debut. Yuji contacted the trainees Hani, Haeryeong, and Junghwa to audition for AB, and all three were subsequently accepted into the agency. The group added a fifth member when Shinsadong Tiger discovered LE, an underground rapper and songwriter who performed under the name 'Elly'. Dami, who was already an AB trainee, was the sixth and last member added to the group.[5] Originally named "WT", an acronym for "Who's That", the group later changed their name to EXID, an initialism for "Exceed in Dreaming", a few months before their debut.[6] In December 2011, LE was featured in Huh Gak's single "Whenever You Play That Song", which appeared on Korean music charts.
